\section{Introduction}


We are concerned with the solution of linear sysutems 
 \begin{equation}
 Ax = b, \qquad x,b \in \Bbb{R}^n,\, A\in \Bbb{R}^{n\times n},
\label{eq:linsys}
\end{equation}
where the matrix $A$ is large and sparse;  \emph{large}  in our
context means millions or even billions of unknowns, whreas
\emph{sparse} means that most coefficients in $A$ are zero, and it is
convenient to employ special storage formats. 

Many popular algorithms for large and sparse systems are
\emph{iterative}, i.e. starting from an initial guess $x_0$ they build
a sequence of approximations  $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_i$ that (hopefully)
converges to the solution of~\ref{eq:linsys}; since the time to
solution is determined by the product between the number of iterations
and the time per iteration, it is clear that the most effective
methods will be the ones that achieve an optimal trade-off between the
method complexity and its speed of convergence. 

A critical feature of practical methods is the use of preconditioners,
i.e transformation of the type 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:preclinsys}
M^{-1}Ax=M^{-1}b.
\end{equation} 
that aim at improving the spectral qualities of the resulting system
matrix, and therefore achieve better convergence; note that the
product $M^{-1}A$ is usually  not computed explicitly. 

When dealing with preconditioned iterations, we need to find the
optimal tradeoff between the following factors:
\begin{itemize}
\item The setup time of the iteration/preconditioner;
\item The runtime  efficiency of the kernels necessary to apply the 
  preconditioner at each iteration; 
\item The reduction in the number of iterations to convergence that
  can be achieved;
\item The sensitivity of the method/preconditioner pair to the usage
  conditions, e.g. the number of computational cores on which the
  program is run. 
\end{itemize}
An ideal solver/preconditioner pair will achieve convergence in few
iterations, each one failry cheap, with the number of iterations to
convergence independent of the degree of parallelism desired.
