\section{Conclusions}
In this paper we have presented an implementation of AMG
preconditioners running on clusters equipped with NVIDIA GPUs; the
implementation is based on our set of packages PSBLAS and MLD2P4. 
We have presented results on a groundwater simulation from the H2020
EoCoE project, showing scalability up to 128 GPUs and 256 millions
equations. 

Future work will include exploration of alternative aggregation
schemes, such as the one presented in~\cite{bcm-toms}, as well as the
development of a GPU-enable preconditioner setup code, to speed-up the
overall solution phase.
